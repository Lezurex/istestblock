# istestblock
Blocks [isTest2](https://istest2.ch) from tracking your mouse and making you able to cheat.

## How to install

### Firefox

- Visit the [extension page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/istest-block/) on the Mozilla Add-On store.
- Click **Add to Firefox**
- The extension is now active and will remove all anticheat event listeners on istest2.

### Chromium

> **NOTE**: Google Chrome does not allow the use of this Addon, because it is not listed in the Chrome Web Store. However, you can install it in most other Chromium-based browsers like Chromium, Brave, Opera...

- Download the .crx-file in the [latest release](https://github.com/Lezurex/istestblock/releases/latest).
- Drag the downloaded file into your browser.
- Confirm your action in the browsers popup.

If this doesn't work, you'll need to load it as an **unpacked extension**. This method should also work for Google Chrome.

- Download the Firefox version (.zip) from the [latest release](https://github.com/Lezurex/istestblock/releases/latest) and extract it or clone this repo somewhere on your device.
- Open the extensions page of your browser.
- Enable developer mode.

- Click on **Load unpacked**.
- Navigate to the extracted folder or repository and select it.
- The extension should now be loaded and be active.

#### Why isn't the extension available in the Chrome Web Store?

To publish an extension there, you first need to pay a one-time payment of 5$, which I am not able to do.
